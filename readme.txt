Fluorescence Image Evaluation Software for Tracking and Analysis 1.01.0004
Copyright (C) 2012  Felix Ruhnow

Welcome to FIESTA, a Fluoresecent Image Evaluation Software for Tracking 
and Analysis developed in MatLab. The program is able to detect both 
point-like (e.g. molecules, beads) and elongated objects (e.g. filaments) 
with nanometer precision and fully automated. It includes further analysis 
tools like drift correction, color offset calculation, path statistics and 
mean-square-calculation.

You can help to improve FIESTA by adding pages in the documentation, 
writing your own tutorials, reporting bugs, requesting enhancements or 
creating plug-ins.
